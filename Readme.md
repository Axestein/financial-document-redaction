# üõ°Ô∏è Guardian: AI-Powered Financial Document Redaction

Guardian is an intelligent, AI-driven solution designed to automatically detect and redact sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from financial documents, ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance for the banking and fintech industries.

## üéØ The Problem

Financial documents like loan applications, KYC forms, and invoices are filled with sensitive PII (account numbers, SSNs, signatures). Sharing these documents across departments or with partners creates a significant risk of data leaks, while manual redaction is slow and prone to human error.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

Guardian provides a robust, automated pipeline to sanitize your documents securely. It intelligently identifies and scrubs sensitive information from a variety of formats, preserving the integrity of the original document structure.

### Key Features:

* **Comprehensive PII Detection**: Identifies a wide range of sensitive data including:
    * **Textual PII**: Account numbers, SSNs, client names, and SWIFT codes.
    * **Visual PII**: Signatures, handwritten notes, bank logos, stamps, and barcodes.
    * **Hidden Metadata**: Cleans sensitive information from document properties.
* **Multi-Format Support**: Processes a variety of document types with ease:
    * PDFs (including scanned documents).
    * Images (JPEG, PNG) like checks and invoices.
    * Tabular Data (Excel/CSV).
* **Innovative Hybrid Approach**: Our unique selling point is the combination of:
    * **Rule-Based Precision**: Uses Regex for well-defined patterns like SWIFT codes.
    * **AI-Powered Context**: Employs advanced NLP to understand context (e.g., distinguishing an "Account No" from a "Page No").
* **Table-Aware Redaction**: Preserves the structure and readability of tables while redacting sensitive cells, a crucial feature for financial statements.
